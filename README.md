+ interactive exercises and quizzes designed with [H5P](https://h5p.org/)
+ interactive demonstrations developed with [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) and [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)
+ R tutorials for the end-of-chapter exercises of _itns_

GitHub resources of this book can be found in two places:

+ [`itns-exercises`](https://github.com/petzi53/itns-exercises/) (link to the repo on the top of this book) is the central part of the book containing all H5P-exercises and the R tutorials/solutions for the end-of-chapter exercises. 
+ [`itns-interactive`](https://github.com/petzi53/itns-interactive/) supplements the main book with exercises written in `learnr` and `shiny`. Whereas the content of the main book is published at the [bookdown server](https://bookdown.org/pbaumgartner/itns-exercises) are the interactive demonstrations of this repository published at the [shinyapps server](https://www.shinyapps.io/).
