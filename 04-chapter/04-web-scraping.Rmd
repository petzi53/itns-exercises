# Normal distribution (outsourced)

## Additional challenge:

Both graphs above are calculated from data. The first one from [data on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_deaths_by_year) using python, the second one used [data from a life table](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6_2013.html) of the US social security administration.

This opens up three questions for exercises:

1. How to get data from websites 
2. How to get from Excel sheets not especially prepared?
2. How to draw these above distributions?


## Getting data from a table on a web page

### Get table data with web scraping

To get data from web pages is called **web scraping**. You will find with a search term line "R web scraping" many articles, tutorial and videos how to do it. Here I am going to use a [blog post by Cory Nissen](http://blog.corynissen.com/2015/01/using-rvest-to-scrape-html-table.html). 

We are going to use the R package `rvest` to write an appropriate script. 

Look at the [US period life table from 2016](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html): How to get the necessary data for the updates graph of figure 2?




```{r scrap-web-table}
# install/load package `rvest`
if (!require("rvest"))
        {install.packages("rvest", repos = 'http://cran.wu.ac.at/')
        library(rvest)}

# store the web url of the page with the table you are interested in
url <- "https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html"
life_table_2016 <- url %>%
  read_html() %>% # from package xml2
  ## 1) go to webpage via google chrome
  ## 2) set cursor on start of the desired table data
  ## 3) right clicked and chose “inspect element”
  ## 4) look for the appropiate line <table …> in the inspector (typically some lines above)
  ## 5) select this <table …> line in the inspector
  ## 6) right click it and select "Copy -> Copy XPath"
  ## 7) include the copied XPath into next line of the R script
  html_nodes(xpath='//*[@id="content"]/section[2]/div/div[3]/table') %>%
  html_table(fill = TRUE)
life_table_2016 <- life_table_2016[[1]]
```

To clarify how to get the correct XPath data compare the following screenshots:

<br /><br />

![**Screenshot 2:** Step 4 of web scraping: look for the appropiate line <table …> in the inspector (typically some lines above)](img/Webscrape/Webscrape-2-min.png)

<br /><br />
![**Screenshot 3:** Step 5 of web scraping: select this <table …> line in the Google Chrome inspector and the complete table on the web page will be selected](img/Webscrape/Webscrape-3-min.png)
<br /><br />

![**Screenshot 4:** Step 6 of web scraping: right click it and select from the context menue "Copy -> Copy XPath"](img/Webscrape/Webscrape-4-min.png)
<br /><br />

### Copy table data into a Excel sheet

Another simple way is to 

1. select the table on the web page (without header and footnotes)
2. copy it into the clipboard
3. fire up Excel
4. set the cursor of the first cell of an empty Excel sheet
5. paste the content of the clipboard into the Excel sheet
6. save the data as a .csv file in your appropriate RStudio project folder

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
**Note:** In order to save the data in the correct format you must use the (american) number format with ',' as grouping character and '.' as the decimal character.
</div>



## Tidy data

### Tidy data frame from web scraping

Looking at the start and tail of the table we see that we need to make the following changes:

1) We only need column 1, 3 and 6 for displaying the age distribution at time of the deaths. 
2) We need to delete the first and last row as it includes textual header information.
3) We need to convert the character columns into columns containing numbers.
3) We need to calculate the number of death from the survival numbers.

```{r tidy-life-table}
# Looking at start and end of table
head(life_table_2016)
tail(life_table_2016)

# We only need column 1, 3 and 6  and have to delete the last (text) line
life_table_2016_v2 <- life_table_2016[c(-1,-nrow(life_table_2016)), c(1,3,6)]

# We need to convert the character columns into columns containing numbers
# In the columns with big number we have additionally to delete all commas from the strings
life_table_2016_v2$`Exact age` <- as.numeric(life_table_2016_v2$`Exact age`)
life_table_2016_v2$Male <- as.numeric(gsub(",","",life_table_2016_v2$Male))
life_table_2016_v2$Female <- as.numeric(gsub(",","",life_table_2016_v2$Female))


# We calculate the difference between rows
life_table_2016_v3 <-
  abs(tail(life_table_2016_v2[, -1], -1) - head(life_table_2016_v2[, -1], -1))
names(life_table_2016_v3)[1] <- "MaleDeath"
names(life_table_2016_v3)[2] <- "FemaleDeath"

# To bind the two data frames we need the same number of rows
firstLine <- data.frame(0,0)
names(firstLine)[1] <- "MaleDeath"
names(firstLine)[2] <- "FemaleDeath"

life_table_2016_v3 <- rbind(firstLine, life_table_2016_v3)
lifetable_final <- cbind(life_table_2016_v2, life_table_2016_v3)

# For easier access change variable name 'Exact age' to 'age'
names(lifetable_final)[1] <- "age" 
```


### Tidy data from Excel sheet

We need to inspect and tidy our .csv file. Follow the procedure below:

1) Click in RStudio project folder the .csv file name and select "View File" from the drop down menu which appears under your cursor

![**Screenshot 5:** Step 1 to tidy the Excel sheet: Click the .csv filename from RStudio in your project folder and select "View File" from the drop down menue](img/Lifetable/Lifetable-1-min.png)
<br /><br />

2) Insert a new line (row) at the top of the file and add column names as I did. Save the file.

![**Screenshot 6:** Step 2 to tidy the Excel sheet: Insert a new line (row) at the top of the file and add column names as in the screenshot](img/Lifetable/Lifetable-2-min.png)
<br /><br />

3) Click another time of the now changed .csv file name in your RStudio project folder: The same drop down menu opens up as before. This time select "Import Dataset…"

![**Screenshot 7:** Step 3 to tidy the Excel sheet: Click the filename in your RStudio project folder and choose "Import Dataset…" from the drow down menue which appears under your cursor.](img/Lifetable/Lifetable-3-min.png)
<br /><br />

4) A overlay window to import text data appears. But the format of the data are not correct. The reason is that we have to change the delimiter from comma to semicolon.

![**Screenshot 8:** Step 4 to tidy the Excel sheet: Change the delimiter parameter from comma to semicolon separated.](img/Lifetable/Lifetable-4-min.png)
<br /><br />

5) Now you can see the table in the correct format. In the window in the right corner you can also see the R code which generated after you click the button "Import". You can use the next time this code as a template for the automatic import via R script.

![**Screenshot 9:** Step 5 to tidy the Excel sheet: The table is now in the correct format and you can click "Import".](img/Lifetable/Lifetable-5-min.png)
<br /><br />

6) You can now inspect the data in a new tab in your code window. In the console window you can also check for the applied source code and the generated messages. You will see how the package `readr` has the data parsed and estimated the column specification.

![**Screenshot 9:** Step 6 to tidy the Excel sheet: Inspecting the data in a new tab in your RStudio code window](img/Lifetable/Lifetable-6-min.png)
<br /><br />


```{r tidy-life-table-2}
# load .csv file into variable
lifetable <- read_delim("lifetable.csv", ";", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)

# We only need column 1, 3 and 6
lifetable_v2 <- lifetable[, c(1,3,6)]

# We calculate the difference between rows
lifetable_v3 <-
  abs(tail(lifetable_v2[, -1], -1) - head(lifetable_v2[, -1], -1))
names(lifetable_v3)[1] <- "MaleDeath"
names(lifetable_v3)[2] <- "FemaleDeath"

# To bind the two data frames we need the same number of rows
firstLine <- data.frame(0,0)
names(firstLine)[1] <- "MaleDeath"
names(firstLine)[2] <- "FemaleDeath"

lifetable_v3 <- rbind(firstLine, lifetable_v3)
lifetable_final <- cbind(lifetable_v2, lifetable_v3)
```




## Display distribution for age at time of death

```{r display-age-distribution}
df <- reshape2::melt(lifetable_final[,c(1,4,5)] ,  
                     id.vars = 'age', variable.name = 'Gender')
ggplot(df, aes(age, value)) + 
  geom_line(aes(colour = Gender)) +
  labs(x = "Age of death in years",
       y = "Death per 100,000") +
  scale_color_discrete(labels = c("Male", "Female")) +
  theme(legend.position = c(.9,.8))

```
