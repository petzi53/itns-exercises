## Progress Table {-}

The following table gives you an overview of the H5P content types used by different chapters. The number before the slash counts the number of H5P content types. The second number sums up the kind of exercises hidden behind frameworks like `Course Presentation`, `Interactive Video`, and `Questions Set`. 

For instance, as you can see, there is no single usage of the H5P content type `Multiple Choice` because it allows just one multiple-choice question. But it is a heavily used exercise type used in the frameworks mentioned above.

Parenthesises around the Shiny apps mean that a working version available but still missing some features.
